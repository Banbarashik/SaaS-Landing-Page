A landing page for a SaaS product based on a Figma mockup. Additionally, I worked on the following features that were not in the original mockup:

1. Implemented principles of responsive design to ensure the page looks good on devices of any size.
2. Created a mobile menu.
3. Developed a slider for the testimonials section.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, Webpack.
